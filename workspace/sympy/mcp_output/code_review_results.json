        "description": "Lack of detailed exception handling in request processing, which could cause the service to crash when encountering errors.",
        "suggestion": "It is recommended to add try-except blocks in key functional implementations to catch and handle possible exceptions, and to log error information for debugging."
      },
      {
        "severity": "Medium",
        "description": "The code lacks validation for input parameters, which could lead to unexpected behavior with incorrect input.",
        "suggestion": "It is recommended to use Pydantic or other validation libraries to ensure the correctness and completeness of input parameters."
      },
      {
        "severity": "Low",
        "description": "Dependency versions are too loose, which could lead to the installation of incompatible library versions.",
        "suggestion": "It is recommended to specify the version range of dependencies to ensure compatibility and stability."
      }
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Strengthen the exception handling mechanism to ensure that the service can gracefully handle and log errors when they occur.",
      "Perform strict validation of input parameters to prevent incorrect input from causing service anomalies.",
      "Clearly define the version range of dependencies to ensure compatibility and stability.",
      "Conduct regular security audits to identify and fix potential security vulnerabilities."
    ],
    "summary": "The overall code structure is reasonable and the functional implementation is good, but there is room for improvement in exception handling and input validation. Dependency management needs to be stricter to ensure the stability and security of the service. It is recommended to strengthen code quality control and follow Python best practices to improve code maintainability and security."
