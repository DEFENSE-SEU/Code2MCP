# TextBlob MCP (Model Context Protocol) Service

## Project Overview

TextBlob is a Python library for processing textual data, focusing on simplifying Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. It provides an easy-to-use API for performing various NLP operations, such as part-of-speech tagging, sentiment analysis, noun phrase extraction, and more. TextBlob is suitable for rapid prototyping and educational purposes, and has the potential to be converted into an MCP (Model Context Protocol) service.

## Installation

To use the TextBlob service, ensure you have the following dependencies installed in your environment:

- Python
- NLTK
- Pattern

You can install TextBlob via pip with the following command:

```
pip install textblob
```

## Quick Start

Here are examples of how to call TextBlob's main features:

1. Create a TextBlob object to process text.
2. Use the Word and WordList classes for word operations.
3. Use the Sentence class for sentence-level operations.
4. Use the Blobber factory class to support batch processing.

Example code:

```
from textblob import TextBlob

text = "TextBlob is a great library!"
blob = TextBlob(text)

# Part-of-speech tagging
print(blob.tags)

# Sentiment analysis
print(blob.sentiment)

# Noun phrase extraction
print(blob.noun_phrases)
```

## Available Tools and Endpoints

TextBlob provides the following main functional endpoints:

- **TextBlob Class**: The main interface class for processing text.
- **Word and WordList Classes**: For operations on words and lists of words.
- **Sentence Class**: For sentence-level operations.
- **Blobber Factory Class**: Supports batch processing of TextBlob objects.
- **Part-of-Speech Tagger**: Identifies the part of speech of words in the text.
- **Noun Phrase Extractor**: Extracts noun phrases from the text.
- **Sentiment Analyzer**: Analyzes the sentiment polarity of the text.

## Common Issues and Notes

- **Dependency Issues**: Ensure that the NLTK and Pattern libraries are installed to support all features.
- **Environment Configuration**: It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
- **Performance Considerations**: Pay attention to performance optimization when processing large-scale text.
- **Extensibility**: TextBlob is designed to be modular, allowing users to extend and customize its functionality.
